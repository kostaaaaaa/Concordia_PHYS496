## General strategies for band structure of Moiré systems

Two dimensional(2D) systems have opened up routes to investigating many new fundamental and applied concepts in condensed matter and materials physics. This development was largely driven by graphene which can be exfoliated easily down to a monolayer. This ease has also prompted researcher to study bi- and multilayer systems, which also demonstrate novel properties. Perhaps the most remarkable one is simply twisting one layer relative to the other that tunes the system through a strong correlation phases like the Mott Insulator, superconductivity, and density wave orders. Inspired by this, researchers have started exfoliating other systems and started to introduce twists. Such twisted system are generally referred to as Moiré systems due to the periodic patterns they set up.

With this being the general direction of current research, we would like to understand at a general level to study the electronic structure of twisted systems. The role of triangular vs square lattice, the role of layers, and understand if there is anything special happening at certain twist angles (like we get flat bands in graphene layers). To achieve this, the project has two major goals:

1. We will first understand building the Brillouin zone for the twisted systems and understand constructing such zones for any given lattice (mostly square and triangular).
2. We will develop a scheme to write down the continuum limit Hamiltonian at appropriate energy scales of the system and develop an understand of its evolution in a manner that is not specific to graphene. This may help us understand the role of symmetries in the band structure evolution.

These will serve as platform to further investigate other interesting phenomena in such systems that can arise from spin-orbit coupling, applying strain, applying electric and magnetic fields, etc. on general grounds.
